This is a branch used for storing assets (images, videos, etc.) for the project.

It used to be possible to just upload videos/images inside PRs or Issues and just link to them but that is now no longer possible as those are hosted behind an expiration with JWT token so they can't be reliably used for linking to in documentation.
